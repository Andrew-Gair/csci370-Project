to compile the program, type 'make'.

to run the program, type './project'.

The source code is contained in main.cpp.
database_mkr.txt has all the sql commands needed to replicate the database used for the project (also found in report).

Before the program runs, the user will have to login to oracle with a valid username and password.
After this login, the program will execute.


the program will prompt the user for input as it runs. An invalid entry will result in an error message, and return
the user to the selection-menu. Incorrect (but still valid) entries will run the query and return an empty table.
To exit, follow the prompts provided until returned to the main menu, then type 'quit'.
