Andrew Gair (Gairad) Project Proposal: Snapshot Train Management Application

Application Domain:
The application itself is a Railway Management software, which if used in the real world
would keep track of trains on the Railway in real-time. For the purposes of this project,
this real-time aspect will be assumed only, and not implemented. Instead, the project
will work with a snapshot, the status of the railway at a given time, say 13:02.

The program will show a train's planned operations throughout a 24 hour period.
  Included will also be a cargo tracking feature, see where a given cargo should be at the end of the day, and track where it has been earlier in the day.

Every midnight the operations for all trains will be updated and new routes organized.
  This means the application assumes all trains arrive at their final destination before midnight each night.
  
The current time is assumed to be 13:02.

The functionality of the application will include:
:)  -See all stops a given train makes throughout a day and at what times those stops are planned to occur at (trains may fall behind schedule).
:)  -See where a selected train currently is at the current time (shown by time to next stop and which station the train is stopping at next).
:)  -See all trains that stop at a given station during the entire day and at what times.
:)  -See all trains that have carried, or are scheduled to carry a given piece of cargo throughout the day. (and also which train or station the cargo is currently on)
      >This functionality allows the real-time tracking of cargo as well as tracking the route it should end up taking throughout the day.
:(  -See all cargo that a given train holds at the current time.
:(  -See who is staffing a station or train at the current time.
